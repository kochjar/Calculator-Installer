## Features
One of the features of this calculator is that every button and action can be written with the keyboard. For example, you can type `sqrt()` to enter the square root symbol. This makes it easy and convenient to use the calculator without having to rely on the mouse.

In addition to keyboard shortcuts for individual buttons, there are also global keyboard shortcuts that can be used to control the calculator:

-   `Ctrl+Enter`: Open or close the app
-   `Ctrl+Backspace`: Clear the current calculation
-   `Enter`: Evaluate the current calculation

## Installation
To use this calculator, simply clone this repository or download the code as a zip file. The installer is included in the code, so there's no need to run any additional setup.

## Usage
Once you have the code, navigate to the directory where it's saved and run the Calculator.msi file. Note that when you run the program on Windows, you may see a Windows Defender warning message. This is because I haven't obtained a digital certificate to sign the code. However, the code is safe and you can choose to download and run the installer at your own risk. Alternatively, you are welcome to scan the installer through VirusTotal or other anti-virus engines or software.
